    	X-Sim PID For SABERTOOTH 2x60
        I write this code, because the official code in x-sim site, don't worked with me. After long time testing without results, i resolved to write my owner code.
        This code are to use with Sabertooth 2x60. All pins are the same of original configuration. It's are configured to comunicate with between arduino and sabertooth in baundrate 38400.
        Digital PIN 12, need to be connected in S1 of sabertooth. GND of arduino with GND of sabertooth. 5V of Sabertooth in Vin of Arduino (just if you need external power).. I don't used.
        Configura the switch of sabertooth, pins 2, 4 , 5 to OFF, others to ON.
        
        WARNING: Don't wiring GND of B- with GND of arduino.
